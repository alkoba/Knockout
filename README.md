A Python typesetting application, licensed under the GPL 3.0 or later.

Runs out of the box on linux systems, start with ``python3.5 main.py test.html``
Try a few example files: ``python3.5 main.py 2014.html``, ``python3.5 main.py 2016.html``
(Other systems may need to install freetype-py and pyhunspell)

An example of an output file generated by this app can be seen at [test.pdf](https://github.com/kelvin13/shifty-octocat/blob/master/test.pdf).
The file syntax is human-readable and based on xml/html; documentation for its specialized modules for mathematical rendering and graph plotting is coming.

Install 
------------
This application should work **out of the box** on a *default* Ubuntu (15.10) installation. It is written in Python 3.5.
However, some libraries might be necessary for SVG rendering because of [cairoSVG](https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG), which depends on the `tinycss` module.
`tinycss` is easily installable through `pip`. If you want emoji support, you will also need to install the [fonttools](https://github.com/behdad/fonttools) module. `fonttools` is also easily installable through `pip`.

### Installing pip
You may have `pip` installed already. (`pip` is the python package manager.) If you are not sure, run the terminal command
````
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
````

### Installing tinycss
````
pip3 install tinycss
````
If `tinycss` still can’t be found, this is most likely because `pip` installed `tinycss` for the *wrong* version of python. In that case, use the more specific command 
````
python3.5 /usr/bin/pip3 install tinycss
````
This problem is quite common, and users with the same problem on other platforms should also try running `pip` from python itself should its libraries install in the wrong locations.

### Installing tinycss
````
pip3 install fonttools
````
Again, if `fonttools` still can’t be found, try running `pip` from python itself to install in the correct location.

Special thanks to the developers of Pygments, Pyphen, fontTools, and CairoSVG for their valuable free libraries.
