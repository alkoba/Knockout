                    'idol, it also served as a treatise on the virtues — '

                    'changes, the stadium screens beamed videos of Ms. '
                    'Swift’s intimates — Karlie Kloss, Selena Gomez, the '
                    'Haim sisters — telling sweet, propagandistic stories '
                    'about their friendship with Ms. Swift.</p><p>And each '
                    'night, Ms. Swift brought out one or more special '
                    'guests onstage — like Miranda Lambert, Lorde or, in '
                    'one case, Julia Roberts and Joan Baez together. As '
                    'spectacular as these moments could be, they still had '
                    'an air of the predictable about them, ripe for '
                    'parody.</p><p>That arrived in August, with “Please '
                    'Welcome to the Stage,” a YouTube '
                    '<strong>video</strong> by Lara Marie Schoenhals in '
                    'which she plays Ms. Swift introducing increasingly '
                    'preposterous, macabre guests: “the hologra<em>m of '

                    'scenario both hilariously absurd and not altogether '
                    'implausible. After all, Ms. Swift’s umbrella is as '
                    'wide as anyone’s, and her tractor beam of friendship '
                    'is powerful.</p><p>Around the same time, Drake was '
                    'having the meaning and potency of his alliances '
                    'challenged, in a much more punishing way. In July, '
                    'his sometime collaborator Meek Mill took to Twitter '
                    'to accuse him of using a ghostwriter. Hip-hop, more '
                    'than any genre, relies on an unspoken good-faith '
                    'network of collaboration. With a handful of tweets, '
                    'Meek Mill tore that playbook up.</p><p>The '
                    'accusations put Drake on the defensive, but within '
                    'weeks, he decisively grabbed the upper hand, '
                    'dispatching Meek Mill with a pair of songs and one '
                    'devastating live performance — Meek Mill lit the '
                    'match, but Drake made sure the bridge was '
                    'burned.</p><p class="h2">The two most important pop '
                    'figures of the last five years, Drake and Ms. Swift '
                    'have both gone further by bringing others along for '
                    'the ride, with varying degrees of intensity and '
                    'sometimes different aims. Friendships versus '
                    'partnerships: Whatever the nomenclature, they have '
                    'been effective for both artists. In both cases, the '
                    'alliances are loud, ingenious, public.</p><p>And yet '
                    'for both artists, that model has begun to collapse, '
                    'whether it was Ms. Swift’s becoming (yet again) an '
                    'object of <strong>judgment</strong> and satire, or '
                    'Drake’s seeing a weakening of the bonds that he’d had '
                    'with his fellow rappers, especially '
                    'up-and-comers.</p><p>Whether born of sincerity or '
                    'expediency or some combination of the two, the '
                    'alliances have been central to the pop takeover by '
                    'Drake and Ms. Swift, stars who sprang from outsider '
                    'genres who now enjoy both mainstream and critical '
                    'acclaim. Seeing Drake and Ms. Swift pal around widely '
                    'is no surprise: Accessibility and intimacy are '
                    'central to both of them. They are simpatico '
                    'songwriters, vividly autobiographical and strikingly '
                    'vulnerable. And both have managed to display a kind '
                    'of everyone-welcome catholicism, allowing others in '
                    'without ever giving up the steering wheel.</p><p>How '
                    'these bonds manifest in their lives and careers, '
                    'though, is very different. Drake is one of the '
                    'savviest collaborators in hip-hop and has made a '
                    'habit of identifying young talents early and bringing '
                    'them into his orbit. The benefits flow both ways — '
                    'the rising artist gets a valuable co-signer and, '
                    'often, a breakout hit; Drake gets a splash of '
                    'youthful energy and credit for bringing an obscure '
                    'idea into the mainstream. For Ms. Swift, her recent '
                    'alliances have seemed more personal than '
                    'professional, insomuch as a hair’s-width space '
                    'between those two can be distinguished. They’re '
                    'different approaches, but both serve the '
                    'brand.</p><p>They’re starting to falter, too, though '
                    '— for many reasons. Drake and Ms. Swift are pop’s '
                    'reigning titans, scrutinized heavily; their habits, '
                    'repeated over time, can begin to appear premeditated. '
                    'And friendship, as strategies go, might have peaked. '
                    'The approach has been perfectly suited to the social '
                    'media age, where online worth is measured in likes '
                    'and favorites, where narratives are curated via '
                    'envy-inducing Instagram posts and where collaboration '
                    'is just a direct message away.</p><p>But too much '
                    'positivity can begin to chafe. Public friendship '
                    'requires a tremendous amount of good will, or '
                    'perceived mutual self-interest. It demands that '
                    'everyone stick to the script — which is why Meek '
                    'Mill’s allegations were so bracing.</p><p>Drake began '
                    'this year, though, with chest puffed, prepared for a '
                    'fight. In February, he surprise-released the mixtape '
                    '“If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late,” which found '
                    'him at his most defensive and wary. “Got a lot of '
                    'people trying to drain me of my energy,” he lamented, '
                    'a harbinger of attacks to come. It’s as if he could '
                    'sense the friendship model’s impending rupture: It '
                    'had gotten him to the top, but it would strand him '
                    'there, too.</p><p>Meek Mill isn’t someone whose '
                    'career Drake has significantly boosted, though they '
                    'have collaborated a couple of times. But his outing '
                    'of the ghostwriter, Quentin Miller, raised eyebrows: '
                    'If you were inclined to regard Drake as a vampire of '
                    'young talent, then this seemed like evidence that he '
                    'was getting to them ever earlier before they even had '
                    'hits of their own to pilfer.</p><p class="block '

                    '(@MeekMill) July 22, 2015 </p><p>Over the past few '
                    'years, Drake has been instrumental in the rise of a '
                    'generation of rappers, whether by collaboration '
                    '(Migos, Future, ILoveMakonnen, Fetty Wap) or by '
                    'inviting them out on tour. Depending how you look at '
                    'it, these are either <strong>the actions of someone '
                    'more enthusiastic about who’s next than about '
                    'established talent or someone who’s relentlessly '
                    'feasting</strong> on new blood. Whichever the case, '
                    'his batting average is astonishingly high.</p><p>And '
                    'yet it has become, if not safe, at least acceptable '
                    'to criticize Drake in public, something that would '
                    'have been more or less unthinkable at this time last '
                    'year. In September, the Houston rapper Sauce Walka, '
                    'part of the Sauce Twinz, released “Wack 2 Wack (Drake '
                    'Disstruction),” a track that followed a couple months '
                    'of potshots in <strong>interviews</strong> and on '
                    'social media, contending that Drake had promised to '
                    'deliver a remix of their regional hit “2 Legited to '
                    'Quited,” but didn’t come through, and that Drake has '
                    'been pilfering Houston style without proper '
                    'respect.</p><p>Drake is from Toronto, but Houston has '
                    'been central to his personal mythology from the '
                    'beginning: He’s immersed in the city’s signature '
                    'sound and slang; he lived there for a time before his '
                    'music took off; he regularly mentions it in song. For '
                    'the last two years he’s held a Houston Appreciation '
                    'Weekend over the summer.</p><p>“<strong>Wack 2 '
                    'Wack</strong>” is a far more effective challenge than '
                    'anything Meek Mill put up, a combination of '
                    'embarrassing personal details (if true) and righteous '
                    'indignation about Drake’s relationship to Houston: '
                    '“It’s cool to show love, but it’s different when '
                    'you’re stealing.”</p><p>Stealing was again the topic '
                    'of conversation surrounding “Hotline Bling,” which '
                    'Drake debuted in July in the thick of the Meek Mill '
                    'squabble. The song owes at least a conceptual debt to '
                    '“Cha Cha,” the slow-sashaying Internet hit by '
                    'D.R.A.M. Last month, D.R.A.M. took to Twitter for '
                    'some light venting: “I feel I got jacked for my '
                    'record … But I’m GOOD.”</p><p>Finally, Drake recently '
                    'posted a video on his Instagram of him dancing to a '
                    'song by the young Florida rapper Kodak Black, causing '
                    'Earl Sweatshirt to note, on Twitter, that Drake “can '
                    'be a bit of a vulture” when it comes to young '
                    'rappers.</p><p>And yet all this flack comes in the '
                    'midst of what might be Drake’s most important year to '
                    'date, one in which two sort-of-albums — “Too Late,” '
                    'and the full-length Future collaboration “What a Time '
                    'to Be Alive” — debuted atop the Billboard album '
                    'chart. “Alive” was also itself a strategic checkmate '
                    'of a project, in which Drake recruited the most '
                    'productive and influential rapper of 2015, Future, '
                    'for a full-length victory lap, capping off his '
                    'takedown of Meek Mill. On “Digital Dash,” the first '
                    'song from that album, Drake rapped, “I might take '
                    'Quentin to Follies” — the Atlanta strip club — not '
                    'worried about a thing.</p><p>That practiced chill in '
                    'the face of fire is something Drake and Ms. Swift '
                    'share, though they represent it differently. Drake '
                    'acknowledges his detractors, while Ms. Swift rarely '
                    'does, instead opting to continue to tell the story '
                    'she wants heard, knowing full well that volume is on '
                    'her side.</p><p>For the past year or so, that story '
                    'has been about friendship. In interviews, Ms. Swift '
                    'has frequently painted her newfound fascination with '
                    'female friendship as a rejoinder to her peak tabloid '
                    'era, two to three years ago, and to her lack of '
                    'girlfriends as a child.</p><p>Certainly, these new '
                    'friendships may be genuine, but these women are more '
                    'often seen in Ms. Swift’s milieu — baking, shopping, '
                    'taking lovely-looking vacations — than she is in '
                    'theirs. They can appear decorative, carefully '
                    'arranged details in a trompe l’oeil of normal '
                    'life.</p><p>Not choosing to turn her friendships into '
                    'professional partnerships is deliberate, Ms. Swift '
                    'told Vogue: “I have attention on me enough, so I want '
                    'my friends to just like me because we have things in '
                    'common rather than me sitting in a corner being like, '
                    '‘Listen to this song that I wrote about my life!’ '
                    '”</p><p>And yet, the two worlds can’t help but '
                    'intermingle. As if to reinforce the essential truth '
                    'of her friendship with Ms. Kloss, the two appeared '
                    'together on the cover of Vogue’s March issue. At '
                    'MTV’s Video Music Awards in August, Ms. Swift arrived '
                    'on the red carpet cloistered among a group of famous '
                    'friends — including the models Gigi Hadid and Cara '
                    'Delevingne and the actresses Hailee Steinfeld and '
                    'Mariska Hargitay — as if for protection. (Those women '
                    'had all appeared in the video for “Bad Blood,” a '
                    'song, perversely enough, about the dissolution of a '
                    'friendship, supposedly with Katy Perry.)</p><p>By '
                    'October, the idea of Ms. Swift’s squad — #squad if '
                    'you’re hashtagging — as a site of coercion, and also '

                    'subject of a sketch on the season premiere of '
                    '“Saturday Night Live.” In it, two women struggle '
                    'their way through a postapocalyptic ruin: everyone '
                    'has left to join Taylor’s gang.</p><p '
                    'class="dialog">“What do they do all day?” one asks '
                    'the other.</p><p class="dialog">“I think she invites '
                    'them onstage and they, like, walk around for a minute '

                    'Drake talk openly about the care with which they '
                    'approach their work and public image. “I monitor what '
                    'people say about me, and if I see a theme, I know '
                    'what that means,” Ms. Swift told GQ, pointing to '
                    'earlier cases: first, when she was young and '
                    'acclaimed, and people doubted her artistic merit; and '
                    'later, when her romantic relationships drowned out '
                    'her art.</p><p>Speaking with The Fader, Drake framed '
                    'his handling of the Meek Mill dust-up in terms of '
                    'strategy. To finish Meek Mill off, he had to make a '
                    'song that would “literally become the song that '
                    'people want to hear every single night” — a bona fide '
                    'hit, which is what “Back to Back” became.</p><p>In '
                    'the song “30 for 30 Freestyle,” from “Alive,” he '
                    'elegantly relates, in just a handful of bars, the '
                    'shift from being the outsider to being top '
                    'dog:</p><p>Rookie season, I would’ve never thought '

                    'getting buckets<br>They put they arm around you, now '
                    'you becoming the crutches</p><p>Here, like on much of '
                    '“Too Late,” Drake is fatigued. His relationships, so '
                    'carefully cultivated, are beginning to become '
                    'burdens. That’s a position Ms. Swift will probably '
                    'never take. If this is her friendship era, it’s '
                    'unlikely she’ll fully detonate it in favor of a new '
                    'mode. Drake is a skeptic, and Ms. Swift is a '
                    'relentless optimist.</p><p>That reflects their '
                    'diverging goals: Ms. Swift is aiming ever more '
                    'global, disconnecting her music from any of its past '
                    'baggage. Drake, by contrast, is turning local, using '
                    'his success as a platform to become even more '
                    'specific. When it comes to others, where Ms. Swift '
                    'sees a happy gaggle to embrace, Drake is starting to '
                    'see a nasty swarm to duck.</p><p>Both tactics have '
                    'their shortcomings. And this year’s blowback has been '
